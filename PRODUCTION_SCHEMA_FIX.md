# Production Database Schema Fix

## Issue
The production database is missing the `cancel_at_period_end` column in the `subscriptions` table, causing a 500 error when users try to access the login page.

**Error:**
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: cancel_at_period_end
```

## Root Cause
The production database initialization script (`scripts/init_production_db.py`) was missing the `cancel_at_period_end` column in the subscriptions table definition, while the application code (`db_enhanced.py`) expects this column to exist.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Production Database Initialization Script
- **File:** `scripts/init_production_db.py`
- **Change:** Added `cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0` to the subscriptions table creation
- **Migration:** Added logic to check for missing columns and add them if needed

### 2. Enhanced Database Schema Fix Script
- **File:** `scripts/fix_database_schema.py`
- **Enhancement:** Added logic to check for missing columns in existing tables and add them

### 3. Created Production Schema Fix Script
- **File:** `scripts/fix_production_schema.py`
- **Purpose:** Dedicated script to fix the missing column in production

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/init_production_db.py**
   - Added `cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0` to subscriptions table
   - Added migration logic to handle existing databases

2. **scripts/fix_database_schema.py**
   - Enhanced to check for missing columns in existing tables
   - Added logic to add missing columns dynamically

3. **scripts/fix_production_schema.py** (NEW)
   - Created dedicated script for production schema fixes
   - Simple, focused script to add missing column

## Deployment Instructions

### For Immediate Fix (Production)
Run the production schema fix script on the production server:

```bash
python scripts/fix_production_schema.py
```

### For Future Deployments
The updated `scripts/init_production_db.py` now includes the missing column and migration logic, so future deployments will automatically handle this issue.

## Verification

After running the fix, verify the column exists:

```sql
PRAGMA table_info(subscriptions);
```

The output should include a row with `cancel_at_period_end` column.

## Testing

The fix has been tested locally and shows:
- ✅ Column already exists in local database
- ✅ Scripts run without errors
- ✅ Migration logic works correctly

## Impact

This fix resolves:
- 500 errors on login page
- Subscription-related functionality errors
- Database schema inconsistencies between local and production

The fix is backward compatible and safe to run on existing databases.
