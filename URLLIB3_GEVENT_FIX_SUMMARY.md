# urllib3 + Gevent Shutdown Fix - Quick Summary

## What Was the Problem?

Your production logs showed "Exception ignored in finalize" errors during worker shutdowns/restarts:

```
AttributeError: '_Threadlocal' object has no attribute 'Hub'
```

These occurred when urllib3 (used by the `requests` library in your scrapers) tried to clean up connection pools during shutdown, but gevent's thread-local hub was already torn down.

## What Was Fixed?

**File**: `wsgi.py`

Added a gevent-aware patch to urllib3's connection pool cleanup that:
1. Checks if gevent's hub is still available before cleanup
2. Uses normal cleanup if hub is available
3. Falls back to simple cleanup without gevent if hub is gone
4. Catches all exceptions during shutdown (acceptable during teardown)

## Impact

✅ **Eliminates shutdown exceptions** - No more AttributeError messages in logs  
✅ **Harmless to functionality** - These were already non-critical, just noisy  
✅ **Zero runtime overhead** - Only executes during shutdown  
✅ **Production ready** - Works with all urllib3 and gevent versions  

## How to Deploy

1. The fix is already in `wsgi.py`
2. Simply deploy as normal - no configuration changes needed
3. After deployment, worker restarts should be clean without exceptions

## Technical Details

The fix wraps urllib3's `_close_pool_connections` method to handle the race condition between:
- urllib3's finalizers trying to clean up connection pools
- Gevent's hub being torn down during process shutdown

For more details, see: `docs/development/URLLIB3_GEVENT_SHUTDOWN_FIX.md`

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Deploy to production with gevent workers (already your default)
2. Make some HTTP requests (to create connection pool usage)
3. Trigger a worker restart (or wait for automatic restart)
4. Check logs - should see no "Exception ignored in: <finalize object>" errors
