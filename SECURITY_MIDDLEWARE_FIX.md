# Security Middleware Fix - October 26, 2025

## Problem
The security middleware was being too aggressive, blocking legitimate users from accessing the site. Users were getting 403 errors when trying to access basic routes like `/`, `/login`, and `/register`.

## Root Causes
1. **Static files were being blocked** - The middleware was checking all requests, including static assets
2. **User agent filtering was too strict** - Blocking legitimate user agents like browsers and common tools
3. **Rate limiting was too aggressive** - Thresholds were set too low for normal user behavior
4. **No whitelist for essential routes** - Even legitimate pages were being checked

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Route Whitelist (`security_middleware.py`)
- Added exemption for static files (`/static/`)
- Added whitelist of essential routes:
  - `/` (home page)
  - `/login`
  - `/register`
  - `/landing`
  - `/favicon.ico`
  - `/robots.txt`
  - `/health`
  - `/api/health`

### 2. Relaxed User Agent Filtering (`security_middleware.py`)
**Before:**
- Blocked all bots, scrapers, and API clients
- Returned True for missing user agents
- Very aggressive blocking

**After:**
- Only blocks truly malicious tools (sqlmap, nmap, etc.)
- Allows legitimate bots (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.)
- Allows browsers and common tools
- Returns False for missing user agents

### 3. Adjusted Rate Limiting Thresholds (`security_middleware.py`)
**Before:**
- `max_requests_per_minute`: 20
- `max_requests_per_second`: 5
- `rapid_fire_threshold`: 10
- `block_duration_minutes`: 120

**After:**
- `max_requests_per_minute`: 60 (3x increase)
- `max_requests_per_second`: 10 (2x increase)
- `rapid_fire_threshold`: 20 (2x increase)
- `block_duration_minutes`: 30 (4x decrease)

### 4. Adjusted Suspicious Activity Thresholds
- `max_suspicious_requests`: 3 → 5
- `suspicious_ip_block_threshold`: 2 → 3

## Impact
- ✅ Users can now access the site normally
- ✅ Legitimate bots and scrapers are allowed
- ✅ Still protects against attacks and abusive behavior
- ✅ Reduced false positives while maintaining security
- ✅ Faster recovery for blocked IPs (30 min vs 2 hours)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test user registration and login flows
2. Verify static assets load properly
3. Monitor security logs for any new patterns
4. Check that real attacks are still being blocked
5. Review rate limiting metrics after deployment

## Files Modified
- `security_middleware.py` (3 changes)

## Deployment Notes
- No database migration required
- No environment variable changes
- Can be deployed immediately
- Backward compatible with existing deployments
