```

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:5000/register`

3. **Try registering WITHOUT checking the box:**
   - Fill in username, email, password
   - Leave checkbox unchecked
   - Click Register
   - ‚úÖ Should see error: "You must agree to the Terms of Service"

4. **Try registering WITH checkbox checked:**
   - Fill in all fields
   - Check the ToS checkbox
   - Click Register
   - ‚úÖ Should successfully register and redirect to login

5. **View the Terms:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/terms`
   - ‚úÖ Should see full terms page
   - ‚úÖ Back button should work

6. **Check database:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 superbot.db "SELECT username, tos_agreed, tos_agreed_at FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show tos_agreed=1 for new user

UPDATE users 
SET tos_agreed = 1, tos_agreed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE tos_agreed = 0;
```

**Option 2: Require Acceptance on Next Login**

- Redirect to terms acceptance page if not agreed
- Record agreement before allowing access

**Option 3: Optional Review**
- Show banner: "We've updated our Terms of Service"
- Provide link to review
- Don't block access but encourage review

### For Future Updates

When you update the terms:
1. Edit `templates/terms.html`
2. Update the "Last Updated" date
3. Consider emailing users about changes
4. For major changes, may require re-acceptance
