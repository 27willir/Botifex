-- Count agreements
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE tos_agreed = 1;

-- View recent agreements
SELECT username, tos_agreed_at 
FROM users 
WHERE tos_agreed = 1 
ORDER BY tos_agreed_at DESC;

-- Find users who haven't agreed (existing users)
SELECT username FROM users WHERE tos_agreed = 0;
```

### 3. Check Terms Page
