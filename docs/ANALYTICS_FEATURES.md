### Customizing Price Ranges

Modify the price range logic in the `save_listing` function:

```python
if price < 5000:
    price_range = "Under $5K"
elif price < 10000:
    price_range = "$5K-$10K"
# Add more ranges as needed
```

The charts use Chart.js and can be customized by modifying the chart configurations in `analytics.html`.
