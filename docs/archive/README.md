# ðŸ“¦ Documentation Archive

This folder contains archived documentation that may be outdated or superseded by newer documentation.

## Purpose

Documentation is archived when:
- It's been superseded by newer, more comprehensive documentation
- The features described have been significantly changed
- It's no longer relevant to current versions
- It's kept for historical reference only

## Archived Documents

Currently, this folder is empty. Documents will be moved here when:
1. Major version updates make them obsolete
2. Features are deprecated or removed
3. Better documentation replaces older versions

## Accessing Archived Docs

If you need to reference older documentation:
1. Check the date in the document header
2. Verify which version it applies to
3. Consult current documentation first
4. Use archived docs only for historical context

## Retention Policy

Archived documentation is kept for:
- Major version documentation: 2 years
- Feature documentation: 1 year after feature removal
- Bug reports: 6 months after fix
- Implementation summaries: Permanent (historical record)

**Note**: Always refer to the main documentation first. Archived documentation may contain outdated information.
