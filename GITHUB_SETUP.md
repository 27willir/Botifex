# üöÄ Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

This guide will help you push your Super-Bot project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account ([sign up here](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one)

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Super-Bot marketplace scraper"
```

## Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it (e.g., `super-bot` or `marketplace-scraper`)
5. **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables (IMPORTANT!)

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: Your `.env` file with actual API keys is already excluded by `.gitignore`.

For anyone cloning your repository, they should:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and fill in their own credentials:
   - `SECRET_KEY` - Generate a secure random string
   - `SMTP_*` - Email notification settings
   - `TWILIO_*` - SMS notification settings (optional)
   - `STRIPE_*` - Payment processing credentials

## Step 5: Verify What's Excluded

Your `.gitignore` already excludes:
- ‚úÖ `.env` files (API keys, secrets)
- ‚úÖ `*.db` files (your database)
- ‚úÖ `venv/` (Python virtual environment)
- ‚úÖ `logs/` (log files)
- ‚úÖ `__pycache__/` (Python cache)
- ‚úÖ `backups/*.db` (database backups)

## Making Updates

After making changes to your code:

```powershell
# Check what files changed
git status

# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Repository Settings Recommendations

### 1. Add a Description
Go to your repository settings and add a description like:
> "A powerful marketplace scraper for Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, KSL, and eBay with real-time alerts and subscription features"

### 2. Add Topics/Tags
Add relevant topics to help others discover your project:
- `web-scraping`
- `marketplace`
- `craigslist`
- `facebook-marketplace`
- `ebay`
- `flask`
- `python`
- `real-time-alerts`

### 3. Choose a License
Consider adding an open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, etc.) if you want others to use your code.

## Security Checklist ‚úÖ

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] No `.env` file in the repository (should be in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys in Python files
- [ ] No actual database files committed
- [ ] No sensitive user data in the repository
- [ ] `.env.example` has placeholder values only

## Collaborating

If you want others to contribute:

1. Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with contribution guidelines
2. Set up branch protection rules on `main`
3. Create issues for bugs/features
4. Review pull requests before merging

## Making Your Repository Public vs Private

### Private (Default)
- Only you (and collaborators you invite) can see it
- Good for personal projects or if using commercial APIs
- Free on GitHub

### Public
- Anyone can view and clone your code
- Good for open-source projects and portfolio
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure no secrets are committed first!

To change visibility:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone
2. Click "Change repository visibility"

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all `.env` files are excluded
2. Verify your `.gitignore` is working: `git status` should not show sensitive files
3. Review your commit history: `git log` to see what was committed
