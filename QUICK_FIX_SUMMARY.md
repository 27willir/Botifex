# Quick Fix Summary - Scraper Start/Stop Issue

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Scrapers were starting and immediately stopping in the UI, creating a toggle effect.

**Root Cause**: The Facebook scraper requires Selenium Chrome driver. When driver creation failed, the thread would exit immediately, causing the status to show "Stopped" even though you had just clicked "Start".

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Made Scrapers Resilient
- Scrapers now stay alive even when encountering errors
- Automatically retry failed operations every 30 seconds
- Won't exit on temporary failures

### 2. Added Health Monitoring
- New visual indicators show scraper health:
  - **✓ Running** (green) = Healthy, no errors
  - **⚠ Running** (yellow) = Working but has some errors
  - **⚠ Unhealthy** (orange) = Many errors (5-10/hour)
  - **Stopped** (red) = Not running
- Hover over status to see error details

### 3. New API Endpoint
- `/api/scraper-health` - Get detailed health info for all scrapers

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

### Before:
```
Status: Stopped → Start → Running → Stopped → Start → Running → Stopped...
```

### After:
```
Status: Stopped → Start → Running ✓ (stays running, retries if errors occur)
```

If there are issues (e.g., Chrome not installed):
```
Status: ⚠ Running (hover to see error: "Failed to create driver...")
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### Starting Scrapers
1. Click "Start" on any scraper
2. Status should show "Running" and stay that way
3. If you see ⚠ symbol, hover to see what's wrong

### Checking Health
- Hover over any scraper status to see error details
- Visit `/api/scraper-health` for detailed JSON health data

### If You See ⚠ Warnings

**For Facebook scraper:**
```bash
# Install Chrome and ChromeDriver
# Windows: Download Chrome, then:
pip install webdriver-manager
```

**For other scrapers:**
- Check server logs for specific errors
- Verify internet connection
- Check if website structure changed

## 📊 Health Monitoring

The system tracks errors and applies circuit breaker protection:
- Allows up to 10 errors per hour
- After 10 errors, scraper stops automatically
- Error count resets after 1 hour

## 🚀 Files Changed

1. `scraper_thread.py` - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
2. `app.py` - Added health API endpoint
3. `templates/index.html` - Enhanced UI with health indicators
4. `SCRAPER_STABILITY_FIX.md` - Full technical documentation

## ✅ Testing Verified

- ✅ Imports work correctly
- ✅ Health function returns proper data
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All scrapers show correct status
- ✅ Error tracking functional

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**:
   - Start a scraper
   - Verify it stays in "Running" state
   - Check for health indicators

2. **If you see ⚠ warnings**:
   - Hover to see the error
   - Fix the underlying issue
   - Scraper will automatically recover

3. **Monitor health**:
   - Check dashboard for any unhealthy scrapers
   - Address recurring errors
   - Watch for circuit breaker activations

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Q: Scraper shows "⚠ Running" but not finding listings
**A**: Hover over status to see error. Common causes:
- Chrome/ChromeDriver not installed (Facebook only)
- Website blocking requests
- Network issues

### Q: How do I see detailed errors?
**A**: Three ways:
1. Hover over scraper status in dashboard
2. Visit `/api/scraper-health` in your browser
3. Check server logs: `heroku logs --tail`

### Q: Scraper stopped after many errors
**A**: Circuit breaker activated (10 errors/hour limit). Fix the underlying issue and restart the scraper.
