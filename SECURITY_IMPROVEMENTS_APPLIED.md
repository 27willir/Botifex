# Security Improvements Applied

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Summary

Applied critical security improvements to address worker timeout issues, enhance security blocking, and improve bot detection based on log analysis showing malicious scanning attempts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Gunicorn Configuration Improvements (`gunicorn_config.py`)

**Problem:** Workers timing out and being killed, causing 502 errors and potential memory leaks.

**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ Increased `timeout` from 120 to 180 seconds (handle resource-intensive operations)
- ✅ Added `graceful_timeout = 45` seconds (allow workers to finish gracefully)
- ✅ Increased `keepalive` from 5 to 10 seconds (better connection reuse)
- ✅ Added `max_requests = 1000` (restart workers periodically to prevent memory leaks)
- ✅ Added `max_requests_jitter = 100` (prevent all workers restarting at once)
- ✅ Added request field limits to prevent memory exhaustion:
  - `limit_request_fields = 100`
  - `limit_request_field_size = 8190`
- ✅ Set `preload_app = False` (reduce memory per worker)

### 2. Security Middleware Enhancements (`security_middleware.py`)

**Problem:** Security was working but could be tightened for better protection against automated scanners.

**Solutions Applied:**

#### a) More Aggressive Blocking Thresholds:
- ✅ Reduced `suspicious_ip_block_threshold` from 3 to **2** suspicious requests
- ✅ Reduced `max_suspicious_requests` from 5 to **3** before blocking
- ✅ Increased `block_duration_minutes` from 30 to **60** minutes (longer blocks)
- ✅ Reduced `rapid_fire_threshold` from 20 to **15** requests/10s (more sensitive to DDoS)

#### b) Enhanced Bot Detection:
- ✅ Added known scanner bots to malicious agents list:
  - `ahrefsbot`, `semrushbot`, `dotbot`, `mj12bot`
  - `blexbot`, `screaming frog`, `sitebulb`, `nerdybot`
- ✅ Added `botifex` to allowed patterns (your own bot)
- ✅ Malicious user agents now immediately block IP (was just logging)

#### c) Enhanced Pattern Detection:
- ✅ Added more high-risk patterns to trigger immediate blocking:
  - `index\.php`, `lander.*\.php`, `database\.php`
- ✅ These patterns immediately block IPs without warning

#### d) Fail2ban-Like Behavior:
- ✅ Added `failed_requests` tracking (tracks 404/403 patterns)
- ✅ Added `failed_request_threshold = 10` (block after 10 failed requests)
- ✅ Added `record_failed_request()` method for tracking

#### e) Better Cleanup:
- ✅ Reduced cleanup interval from 5 minutes to **1 minute** (more responsive)
- ✅ Cleanup now clears failed request tracking

## Impact

### Performance Improvements:
1. **Reduced Worker Timeouts:** With increased timeouts and periodic restarts, workers should no longer crash
2. **Better Memory Management:** `max_requests` prevents memory leaks from accumulating
3. **Graceful Handling:** Graceful timeout allows requests to complete before worker restart

### Security Improvements:
1. **Faster Blocking:** Suspicious IPs blocked after 2 attempts instead of 3
2. **Longer Blocks:** 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes (prevents retries)
3. **Better Bot Detection:** New scanner bots detected and blocked
4. **Immediate High-Risk Blocking:** `.php` files and database patterns trigger instant blocks
5. **Fail2ban Behavior:** Repeated failed requests now tracked and blocked

## Expected Results

### Before:
- ❌ Workers timing out after ~120 seconds
- ❌ 502 errors for long-running requests
- ❌ Memory leaks accumulating
- ⚠️ IPs blocked after 3 suspicious attempts
- ⚠️ 30-minute blocks

### After:
- ✅ Workers handle requests up to 180 seconds
- ✅ Graceful worker restarts prevent crashes
- ✅ Periodic worker recycling prevents leaks
- ✅ IPs blocked after 2 suspicious attempts
- ✅ 60-minute blocks (discourage retries)
- ✅ Better detection of scanner bots
- ✅ Immediate blocks for high-risk patterns

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Watch for:
1. **Worker restarts** in logs (should be periodic, not excessive)
2. **Blocked IP count** (should increase with tighter thresholds)
3. **403 responses** (should increase as more bots get blocked)
4. **Memory usage** (should stabilize with worker recycling)

### Metrics to Track:
- Average requests per worker before restart (should be ~1000)
- Time between worker restarts
- Number of blocked IPs over time
- Failed request patterns

## Testing

### To verify improvements:
```bash
# Check worker stability
grep "WORKER TIMEOUT" logs/app.log

# Check blocking activity
grep "blocked for suspicious" logs/app.log

# Monitor memory
ps aux | grep gunicorn
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Cloudflare Integration:** Add Cloudflare for additional DDoS protection
2. **Alerting:** Set up alerts for repeated blocks or high traffic
3. **Rate Limit Tuning:** Adjust based on actual usage patterns
4. **IP Whitelisting:** Add known good IPs to whitelist if needed

## Files Modified

1. `gunicorn_config.py` - Worker configuration
2. `security_middleware.py` - Security enhancements
3. `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS_APPLIED.md` - This document

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert `gunicorn_config.py` timeout back to 120
2. Revert security thresholds to previous values
3. Remove extra malicious agent patterns if false positives occur
